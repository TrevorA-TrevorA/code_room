# Code Room

A real-time collaborative code-editing interface.

**Summary**: Authenticated users can invite one or more people to co-edit source files. During an edit session, each co-editor is subscribed to a websocket channel that broadcasts changes and immediately updates the code for all editors, as well as a second channel for editor chat. Source files can be uploaded, modified, and downloaded through the UI.

I also intend to develop a CLI with watch mode and git integration.

**Backend**: Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL

**UI**: React, Redux, and the Ace Editor API.

**Status**: Currently in development.
